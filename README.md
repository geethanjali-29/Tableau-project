# Tableau-project
Developed dynamic and insightful Tableau visualizations leveraging the comprehensive COVID-19 Data Repository by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University. By harnessing this authoritative and regularly updated dataset, I crafted visually compelling dashboards that provided a nuanced understanding of global COVID-19 trends. Through meticulous data analysis and visualization techniques, I conveyed critical information on cases, deaths, and recoveries, facilitating informed decision-making and fostering a deeper awareness of the ongoing pandemic. This experience showcases my proficiency in utilizing real-time and impactful data sources for creating visually engaging and informative Tableau visualizations.
